The spa not as large and polished as it's top OC rival, Irvine Spa, but it has a lot of character that I personally prefer. It draws almost exclusively a Korean crowd compared to Imperial Spa just up Beach, but they were very friendly to this westerner.  Also, I love that they offer bar soap in the showers, and their disposable toothbrushes are much more firm than the green ones every other Korean spa I have been to."

Where this place falls short is are the saunas and the sleeping area. The \"sleeping\" area is not conducive to sleep. It's a brightly lit, open area in the main locker room.  The saunas are tiny for a spa this size, and the dry one is not nearly as hot as it should be.  Aside from that, it's a nice facility.  The Jjimjilbang and water park are the real key features, but as mentioned above, I'm just reviewing the Men's wet area."
