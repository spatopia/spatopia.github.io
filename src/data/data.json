The spa not as large and polished as it's top OC rival, Irvine Spa, but it has a lot of character that I personally prefer. It draws almost exclusively a Korean crowd compared to Imperial Spa just up Beach, but they were very friendly to this westerner.  Also, I love that they offer bar soap in the showers, and their disposable toothbrushes are much more firm than the green ones every other Korean spa I have been to."
